The co-presence and contact folders contain all six co-presence networks. 
Both contacts and co- presence data are formatted as tij, i.e. each line represents a contact occurring at a time t between two nodes i and j.

metadata.tar contains the lists of nodes, with the first column being the node identifier and the second the group affiliation, when available.
